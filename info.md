On christmas eve, a lady was killed in the train that was occupied by 4 people: the victim and her husband, a single passenger, and cabinet servant. She was wearing a turquoise silky dress lying on the floor. The victim had a heavily bruised neck and a fractured finger. A half-empty glass of water was on her table. Saleem, the investigator, shall find the murderer.


What do u think was the nature of murder
Well after looking at the body's condition there was two possibilities


1. She was suffocated (thus of the bruises on her neck and rist)
2. She was poisoned (since she had a martini/meal next to her) 


1=>They had two suspects of alleged suffocation 

1=>A husband
1=>B train sevant

1=>A=>they found out he was on his sleeping pills so he was out of the picture for now
1=>B=>she was helping a passenger on cabin 3 with his motion sickness 




2=>They had two suspects of alleged poison


2=>A husband
2=>B neighboring cabin(a good looking man in a suit”from what his papers said he’s a bussinus man”)

2=>A=>why would he do it on a train ? Too obvious!!
2=>B=>being a bussinus man doesn’t remove him from being suspected we had to look more into it

2=>B=>a could he be a secrut lover
2=>B=>b a fraud with fake id


2=>B=>a=>(please find something that says he’s not a secret lover so go fuck you self)
2=>B=>b=>looks like he is a fraud after looking more into his papers none of the names where real names, we couldn’t find any name on our systems …..
