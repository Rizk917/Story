        It is christmas, London streets are empty and metros are compiling. Trains are packed with people rushing to their hometowns to celebrate the well-known holiday with their families. 
        A delay in one of the trains led to crowded frustration in the station. One passenger, in particular, decided to distract his boredom with the only thing he is good at, investigation. Saleem is a private investigator that has no skills other than observation.  He noticed that police officers were dispersed within the station; for a lot, this may seem as a normal safety measures on such days, but not for saleem. He realized that officers were divided in a worrying pattern. The live tracker of the delayed train says it has stopped in the previous station. Saleem decided to take the first cab to the train.
        Excitement sparked his eyes upon his arrival; police men surrounding the area, worried faces, murmurs  resonating, dense atmosphereâ€¦  the perfect build up of a murder. He entered the train and analyzed the scene; a lady wearing a tourqouise silky dress lying on the floor. The victim had a heavily bruised neck and a fractured finger. She was in the upper class cabinet. As per the police, the cabinet was occupied by four people: the victim and her husband, a single passenger, and cabinet servant. 
        The endorsed story scheme was implied by the servant;  I was helping passenger in cabinet B with his motion sickness when the lady requested a glass of water. I fetched her the water, asked her husband and their neighboring passenger if they needed anything and retrieved to cabinet B.
        
        Hundreds of possibilities were being studied by saleem. Alibis were not adding up. Suspects had unreadable expressions.
